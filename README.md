# Offuture
## Overview
In this project we were given the task of exploring Offuture's given dataset. We started off by uploading the data onto SQL and carrying out a Quality Control Check which can be found in the [QCF](https://github.com/akshaamod/Offuture/tree/main/QCF) folder. We then used SQL and Tableau to do our exploratory data analysis, which was later [presented](https://github.com/akshaamod/Offuture/tree/main/presentation) to the client.
